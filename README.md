# Task-8
A runnable python script that demonstrates a simple chatbot.
It checks the user's input against a predefined set of rules and provides a corresponding, pre-written response.

Input/Output Loop: To create a continuous conversation, the program needs to repeatedly ask for user input and provide a response. A while loop is perfect for this.

Conditional Logic (if-elif-else): This is the "brain" of the chatbot. It's a series of checks to see if the user's input contains specific keywords or phrases.

Rules: Each if or elif statement represents a rule. For example, "If the user's input contains 'hello', then respond with 'Hi there!'"
